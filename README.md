Demo-Plugin-for-PluginStarter
=============================

A demo plugin to test the PluginStarter system.

This is a fake plugin that will demonstrate checking for and possibly dowloading the base PluginStarter plugin.

Once it is finalized, the file "check-for-plugin-starter.php" can simply be included in each plugin.
